     Parallel version (MPI), running on    32 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =      32

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation      = VDW-DF2 ( 1  4 13  0 2 0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want
